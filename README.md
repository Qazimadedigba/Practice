Practicing my version control skills

I am updating my README.MD file on Github.

Git is a version control system, Github and Gitlab are version control platforms where you can make your repositories public or private.

I learnt about SSh but I couldn't connect with it so I settled for GitBash which I also end up understanding how I can do everything from my CMD.

The 3 stages of code in local repositories are 
a. Working Directory - Git Add . or file name
b. Stage area - Git Commit
c. Local Repository -

I learnt changing colours in CMD color with 1 - I, how CD is used to change directory and dir is used to list directories.

I also learnt about Vim and other text editors.

Git Clone to clone files

Git push to push to the remote directories.
